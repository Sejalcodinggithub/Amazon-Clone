# Amazon-Clone
Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS
In this project, we use HTML simple tags like image, paragraph, div, anchor, heading tags.
We apply CSS to give the look and feel to the website to decorate the text, highlight the text, align the images and texts and so on.
Using HTML and CSS, we developed the Amazon clone for practice.
